A racing car business needs a system to manage its fleet of cars, drivers, and race events. The system should allow:

Adding cars (cup, formula, rally, etc. â€“ using inheritance).

Assigning drivers to cars.

Recording race results (lap times, positions).

Generating reports (cars, drivers, race results, best lap times).

Validating the logic with unit tests.
